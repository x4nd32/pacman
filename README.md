<h1>Demo of Pacman animation with JS</h1>

## Description

This is a javascript demonstration using a Pacman animation that moves back and forth between a browser viewport. It uses four pictures; right-facing  mouth open; right-facing  mouth closed; left-facing  mouth open, left-facing mouth closed. The script runs on a 100ms interval, increases movement by 20px and changes the image per array reference, using if/else statements. 

### Installation

Download the files within the repository and create a nested directory called 'images' to move the Pacman*.png files into. 

##Usage

Double-clicking the index.html file will open the project in the browser window. Use the browser developer tools or another editor to observe the source files.
